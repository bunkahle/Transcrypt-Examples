    <p>This example does not work, it is just for showing how not to do it.</p>
    <p>When running in the browser, all transcrypt/javascript code is executed in a single thread, the UI thread. Which means we canâ€™t run a naive infinite game loop:</p>
    <pre>
      while True:
          render()
    </pre>
    <p>This would block the UI thread, making the browser unresponsive.</p>
    <p>See example <a href="02_canvas.html">02</a>, <a href="03_canvas.html">03</a> and <a href="04_canvas.html">04</a> how to create a game loop or constant update for the canvas</p>
