<p>Something to eat, or not ;-) ? On computer browsers cookies are little pieces of information
stored on the side of the user's computer or browser. When a user visits a website repeatedly
the website can find more information on the user and his behaviour when it has stored cookies
on the side of the user's browser. After each call to the website the programming logic of the
website (Javascript oder Transcrypt) could try to find out if a cookie has recently be stored
and what kind of information was saved in the cookie.</p>
<p>An online shop could store address data or a username in cookies or the website could store the
number of calls to the website from the user in a cookie in the computer of the user.
This makes it easy for websites to adjust to the personal needs of the user or offer anything
which might be appropriate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-are-cookies-built-up">
<h1>How are cookies built up?</h1>
<p>A cookie has three components: Its name, its contents and a expiration date.</p>
<p>So let´s say we want to store the username of a user in a cookie and put it automatically back
into a login form when the user comes back. The cookie could like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
document.cookie = &quot;username=Bob Roberts; expires=Thu, 1 Mar 2018 12:00:00 UTC&quot;
</pre>
<p>With a path parameter, you can tell the browser what path the cookie belongs to. By default,
the cookie belongs to the current page:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
document.cookie = &quot;username=Bob Roberts; expires=Thu, 1 Mar 2018 12:00:00 UTC; path=/&quot;
</pre>
<p>So how do we set a cookie with Python/Transcrypt then?</p>
<p>It is quite easy:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# we import the standard library time module from python
import time

def setCookie(cname, cvalue, exdays):
&quot;This set a cookie with a certain cname with a value cvalue and a time in days exdays for the expiration date&quot;
# get the current time in seconds since the epoch and add exdays multiplied with the seconds of a day
    t = time.time() + (int(exdays)*24*60*60)
    # console.log(t) # you can debug the time in the browser console (hit F12 to view it)
    # time.gmtime gives something like:
    # time.struct_time(tm_year=2018, tm_mon=2, tm_mday=11, tm_hour=22, tm_min=52, tm_sec=22, tm_wday=6, tm_yday=42, tm_isdst=0)
    struc_time = time.gmtime(t)
    # console.log(struc_time) # debugging
    # set the struc_time to a string like: 'Sun, 11 Feb 2018 22:52:22 UTC'
    expires = &quot;expires=&quot; + time.strftime(&quot;%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S UTC&quot;, struc_time)
    # console.log(expires) # debugging
    # and finally set the cookie by setting document.cookie to its value
    document.cookie = cname + &quot;=&quot; + cvalue + &quot;; &quot; + expires + &quot;; path=/&quot;
    # alert(&quot;Cookie set: &quot; + cname + &quot;=&quot; + cvalue + &quot;; &quot; + expires + &quot;; path=/&quot;) # debugging
</pre>
<p>The cookie has now be set. It can be deleted by the user when the user is resetting all the cookies or a cookies
of a certain website in his browser. It will also be deleted if the expiration is reached and the cookie is not
fresh anymore - it has reached its expiration date (best before date like on food items).
But it can also be deleted programmatically by the website by just putting its expiration date to a time
back in the past. The code for this looks like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def deleteCookie(cname):
    &quot;Delete a cookie with the name stored in cname&quot;
    document.cookie = cname + &quot;=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;&quot;
</pre>
<p>Now after the cookie has been set we of course also want to read the cookie back in after the user
visits our website again or has asked for content which has been processed programmatically. So how do we do this?
Of course we know what kind of cookies with certain names had been set in the past by our pages so we request
the names of these cookies and we like to know what has been stored inside these &quot;variables&quot; on the side of the user.
The code is:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def getCookie(cname):
    &quot;Try to find out if a cookie has been set with the name of cname and return its contents, if no cookie is found returnstring == ''&quot;
    name = cname + &quot;=&quot;
    # console.log(&quot;name=&quot;+name+&quot;;&quot;) # debug
    # The decodeURIComponent() function decodes a URI component
    # The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is replacing each occurrence of certain characters
    # with one, two, three or four escape sequences corresponding to the UTF8 encoding of the
    # character. You often see this is the URL line of your browser like this:
    # http://www.transcrypt.org?test.cgi?&amp;username=Bob%20Roberts where %20 decodes the space character
    decodedCookie = decodeURIComponent(document.cookie)
    # console.log(&quot;decodedCookie:&quot;+decodedCookie) # debug
    allcookies = decodedCookie.split(';')
    # console.log(&quot;allcookies:&quot;+allcookies) # debug
    for ca in allcookies:
        # console.log(&quot;ca=&quot;+ca+&quot;;&quot;)
        # if the name of the cookie is found in one of the split list elements
        if name in ca:
            f = ca.find(name)
            # extract the content of the cookie and return it
            c_content = ca[f+len(name):]
            return c_content
    return &quot;&quot;
</pre>
<p>This function returns a cookie in case it had been stored before, otherwise we will get an empty returnstring.</p>
<p><em>Beware</em>: The document.cookie property looks like a normal text string:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
document.cookie = &quot;username=Bob Roberts; expires=Thu, 1 Mar 2018 12:00:00 UTC; path=/&quot;
</pre>
<p>But it is not. Even if you write a whole cookie string to document.cookie, when you read it out again,
you can only see the name-value pair of it, but not the expiration date or the path, so don´t be confused.
If you set a new cookie, older cookies are not overwritten. The new cookie is added to document.cookie,
so if you read document.cookie again you will get something like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
username = &quot;Bob Roberts&quot;
lastvisit = &quot;Dec 31 2017&quot;
</pre>
