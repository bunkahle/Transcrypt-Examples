Python game programming compiled to Javascript

This directory contains a project of the game tetris programmed originally in pure Python. I tried to convert it to 
Javascript via transcrypt but it turned out to be not so trivial as I thought before.

Reason for this is a different programming logic in Javascript. It is also harder to debug than programming it directly in Python. 
So I had to go through some efforts to get at least a part of the original Python program to work. Still the program is not doing 
what the orginal Python code did.

Also if it comes to game programming it is good to know about callbacks, setTimeout and other stuff to get the game engine working.
